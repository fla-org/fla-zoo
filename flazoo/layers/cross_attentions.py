This file implements token mixer layers that support input of the following format:

            hidden_states (`torch.Tensor`):
                The hidden states of the query.
            encoder_hidden_states (`torch.Tensor`, *optional*):
                The hidden states of the encoder.
            attention_mask (`torch.Tensor`, *optional*):
                The attention mask to use. If `None`, no mask is applied.
            **cross_attention_kwargs:
                Additional keyword arguments to pass along to the cross attention.
