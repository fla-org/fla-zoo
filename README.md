## News

- **$\texttt{[2025-02-23]}$:** Add LightNet for classification. Also, SFT training script for vision models is added, check it out in [here](examples/vision/sft.py).

- **$\texttt{[2025-02-20]}$:** I'm currently conducting many experiments to comprehsnively evaluate the performance of FLA models on vision tasks and some critical design aspects. Stay tuned!

- **$\texttt{[2025-01-25]}$:** This repo is created with some vision models (I mean classification model).

## Features

- **`vision`:** `fla-zoo` currently supports vision models. A simple documentation is in [here](docs/vision/vision.md). TL;DR: use hybrid model and random-scan for better performance and efficiency. "Vision" here refers to image classification tasks.
- **`video`:** `fla-zoo` currently supports certain video models. Documentation is in progress.

## Installation

Requirements:
- All the dependencies shown [here](https://github.com/fla-org/flash-linear-attention?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)
- [torchvision](https://github.com/pytorch/vision)

For example, you can install all the dependencies using the following command:
```bash
conda create -n flazoo python=3.12
conda activate flazoo
pip install torch torchvision accelerate
pip install transformers datasets evaluate causal_conv1d einops sklearn wandb
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```
Now we can start cooking! ðŸš€

Note that as an actively developed repo, `fla-zoo` currently no released packages are provided.

## TODO

- [x] Write documentation for vision models.
- [ ] Write documentation for video models.
- [ ] Release training scripts for vision models.
